### About ###

[TIFF](http://ngageoint.github.io/geopackage-tiff-ios/) is an iOS Objective-C library for reading and writing Tagged Image File Format files. It was primarily created to provide license friendly TIFF functionality to iOS applications. Although developed as part of the [GeoPackage Libraries](http://ngageoint.github.io/GeoPackage/), this library does not contain GeoPackage functionality and can be used separately.  Implementation is based on the [TIFF specification](https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/tiff/TIFF6.pdf) and this JavaScript implementation: https://github.com/constantinius/geotiff.js
